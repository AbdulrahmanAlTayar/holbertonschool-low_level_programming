# C Programming - Functions, Loops & Conditionals

This repository contains solutions to a set of tasks focused on basic C programming concepts such as printing characters, checking character types, looping, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations.

## ðŸ§  Project Objectives

- Practice writing functions in C
- Use loops like `for`, `while`, and `do...while`
- Understand character checking functions like `islower()` and `isalpha()`
- Implement logic with `if`, `else`, and `switch`
- Perform arithmetic operations and simple algorithms
