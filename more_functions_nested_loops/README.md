# Holberton School - Low Level Programming

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to various tasks from the **Holberton School** low-level programming project. The tasks are designed to enhance skills in the C programming language, focusing on essential programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and basic algorithms. These exercises are part of the curriculum aimed at mastering the key concepts required for system programming.

The project covers fundamental topics and helps build a strong foundation for more advanced system-level programming tasks. It encourages the development of problem-solving skills through the implementation of various algorithms and logical constructs.

## Project Requirements

- **Language**: C programming language
- **Compilation**: All programs should be compiled using `gcc` with the following flags: `-Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89`
- **Tools**: Each task utilizes the `putchar` function to print characters to the terminal.
  
## Features

The tasks in this project help in:

- Mastering the basics of C programming
- Understanding control flow and logic
- Building familiarity with common algorithms and problem-solving strategies
- Writing efficient and clean code
- Working with functions and loops

## Testing

All programs are tested thoroughly to ensure correctness. Example input and output are provided with each task to guide the user in understanding how the program behaves. Edge cases and performance are also taken into account during the testing phase.
