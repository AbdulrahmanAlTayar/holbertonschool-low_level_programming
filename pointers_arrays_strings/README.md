# 📌 C - Pointers, Arrays and Strings

Welcome to the **"Pointers, Arrays and Strings"** project in C! This part of the Holberton School curriculum introduces fundamental yet powerful concepts that are essential for effective low-level programming. Understanding pointers and arrays is **crucial** to mastering the C language.

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Understand what **pointers** are and how to use them
- Manipulate variables through **pointer dereferencing**
- Understand the relationship between **arrays** and **pointers**
- Use **pointer arithmetic**
- Work with **strings** (arrays of characters)
- Use `sizeof`, `strlen`, and understand **memory layout**
