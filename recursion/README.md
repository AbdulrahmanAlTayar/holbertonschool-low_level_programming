# üìö Recursion in C

This project is part of the **Holberton School Low-Level Programming Curriculum**.  
It focuses on implementing recursive functions in C, building understanding of how recursion works internally.

---

## üß† Concepts Covered

- Basic recursion principles
- String operations with recursion
- Mathematical functions using recursion
- Checking for prime numbers
- Calculating square roots recursively

| File Name              | Description                                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `0-puts_recursion.c`   | Prints a string followed by a new line             |
| `1-print_rev_recursion.c` | Prints a string in reverse                       |
| `2-strlen_recursion.c` | Returns the length of a string                     |
| `3-factorial.c`        | Returns the factorial of a number                  |
| `4-pow_recursion.c`    | Calculates `x` raised to the power of `y`         |
| `5-sqrt_recursion.c`   | Computes the natural square root of a number       |
| `6-is_prime_number.c`  | Determines if a number is a prime number           |
| `main.h`               | Header file with function prototypes               |

## üõ† Compilation

All files can be compiled using the following flags:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 <main_file.c> <function_file.c> _putchar.c -o output
